##ATL WDI - Day 4 Homework - Enumeration & File I/O




**ADD ONTO A PREVIOUS LAB WITH:**

Print each thing needed from the grocery list with this style:

- 01 -- Milk
- 02 -- Eggs

Make an author hash and include information about yourself:

- Create people = [user, author]
- Using enumeration functions on people, return the author hash
- Put previously defined grocery list in a new file
- Pull it in, modify it, write it to a new file

**BONUS**

- Create a method `select_by_name(list_of_users, first_name)` where you can call `select_by_name(people, your_name)` and it will return the author hash

- Push grocery list to a CSV with columns of:
	- Item Number (aka index number + 1)
	- Item Name
	- Make sure to print the column headers to the file
		- **Hint:** Strengthen your Google-fu
		
- Pull in any data from CSV, modify it anyway you want, and output it

- Go back to coderbytes and see how much you can do

- Knock out a few more Project Eulers


**BONUS II**

- If you haven’t already, go back and do the previous bonuses

- Before we said to ignore each method that has a block. This restriction has been lifted. So go back to your arrays.rb and hashes.rb and do each method you didn’t do before.
